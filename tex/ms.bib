	Abstract = {Optimised population synthesis provides an empirical method to extract the relative mix of stellar evolutionary stages and the distribution of atmospheric parameters within unresolved stellar systems, yet a robust validation of this method is still lacking. We here provide a calibration of population synthesis via non-linear bound-constrained optimisation of stellar populations based upon optical spectra of mock stellar systems and observed Galactic Globular Clusters (GGCs). The MILES stellar library is used as a basis for mock spectra as well as templates for the synthesis of deep GGC spectra from Schiavon et al. (2005). Optimised population synthesis applied to mock spectra recovers mean light-weighted stellar atmospheric parameters to within a mean uncertainty of 240 K, 0.04 dex, and 0.03 dex for T_eff, log(g), and [Fe/H], respectively. Decompositions of both mock and GGC spectra confirm the method's ability to recover the expected mean light-weighted metallicity in dust-free conditions (E[B-V] < 0.15) with uncertainties comparable to evolutionary population synthesis methods. Dustier conditions require either appropriate dust-modelling when fitting to the full spectrum, or fitting only to select spectral features. We derive light-weighted fractions of stellar evolutionary stages from our population synthesis fits to GGCs, yielding on average a combined 25+/-6 per cent from main sequence and turnoff dwarfs, 64+/-7 per cent from subgiant, red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars, and 15+/-7 per cent from horizontal branch stars and blue stragglers. Excellent agreement is found between these fractions and those estimated from deep HST/ACS CMDs. Overall, optimised population synthesis remains a powerful tool for understanding the stellar populations within the integrated light of galaxies and globular clusters.},

	Abstract = {Ground-based astronomical spectra are contaminated by the Earth's atmosphere to varying degrees in all spectral regions. We present a Python code that can accurately fit a model to the telluric absorption spectrum present in astronomical data, with residuals of $\sim 3-5\%$ of the continuum for moderately strong lines. We demonstrate the quality of the correction by fitting the telluric spectrum in a nearly featureless A0V star, HIP 20264, as well as to a series of dwarf M star spectra near the 819 nm sodium doublet. We directly compare the results to an empirical telluric correction of HIP 20264 and find that our model-fitting procedure is at least as good and sometimes more accurate. The telluric correction code, which we make freely available to the astronomical community, can be used as a replacement for telluric standard star observations for many purposes.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian method for fitting faint, resolved stellar spectra in order to obtain simultaneous estimates of redshift and stellar-atmospheric parameters. We apply the method to thousands of spectra - covering 5160-5280 {\AA} at resolution R˜ 20 000 - that we have acquired with the MMT/Hectochelle fibre spectrograph for red giant and horizontal branch candidates along the line of sight to the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal satellite in Draco. The observed stars subtend an area of ˜4 deg2, extending ˜3 times beyond Draco's nominal `tidal' radius. For each spectrum, we tabulate the first four moments - central value, variance, skewness and kurtosis - of posterior probability distribution functions representing estimates of the following physical parameters: line-of-sight velocity (vlos), effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity (log g) and metallicity ([Fe/H]). After rejecting low-quality measurements, we retain a new sample consisting of 2813 independent observations of 1565 unique stars, including 1879 observations for 631 stars with (as many as 13) repeat observations. Parameter estimates have median random errors of sigma _{v_{los}} = 0.88 km s-1, sigma _{T_{eff}} = 162 K, sigmalog g = 0.37 dex and sigma[Fe/H] = 0.20 dex. Our estimates of physical parameters distinguish ˜470 likely Draco members from interlopers in the Galactic foreground.},

	Abstract = {We present a modular, extensible framework for the spectroscopic inference of physical parameters based on synthetic model spectra. The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. In the limit of high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is common for stellar parameter estimation, that covariant structure can bias the parameter determinations. We have designed a likelihood function formalism to account for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. We specifically address the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic or molecular data, or radiative transfer treatment) by developing a novel local covariance kernel framework that identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line "outliers." By fitting multiple spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic model spectral libraries. The application of this method, implemented as a freely available open source code, is demonstrated by fitting the high resolution optical (V-band) spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate resolution near-infrared (K-band) spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 dwarf.},

	Abstract = {We present a technique to extract radial velocity measurements from echelle spectrograph observations of rapidly rotating stars ($V\sin{i} \gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$). This type of measurement is difficult because the line widths of such stars are often comparable to the width of a single echelle order. To compensate for the scarcity of lines and Doppler information content, we have developed a process that forward-models the observations, fitting the radial velocity shift of the star for all echelle orders simultaneously with the echelle blaze function. We use our technique to extract radial velocity measurements from a sample of rapidly rotating A- and B-type stars used as calibrator stars observed by the California Planet Survey observations. We measure absolute radial velocities with a precision ranging from 0.5-2.0 km s$^{-1}$ per epoch for more than 100 A- and B-type stars. In our sample of 10 well-sampled stars with radial velocity scatter in excess of their measurement uncertainties, three of these are single-lined binaries with long observational baselines. From this subsample, we present detections of two previously unknown spectroscopic binaries and one known astrometric system. Our technique will be useful in measuring or placing upper limits on the masses of sub-stellar companions discovered by wide-field transit surveys, and conducting future spectroscopic binarity surveys and Galactic space-motion studies of massive and/or young, rapidly-rotating stars.},

	Abstract = {Context. Empirical stellar libraries are extensively used to extract stellar kinematics in galaxies and to build stellar population models. An accurate knowledge of the spectral resolution of these libraries is critical for avoiding propagation errors and uncertain estimates of the intrinsic stellar velocity dispersion of stellar systems, such as galaxies and star clusters.  Aims: In this research note we re-assess the spectral resolution of the MILES stellar library and of the stellar population models based on it. This exercise was performed, because of a recent controversy over the exact MILES resolution.  Methods: We performed our test by comparing MILES stellar spectra with three different sets of higher resolution templates, one fully theoretical - the MARCS library - and two empirical ones, namely the Indo-US and ELODIE v3.1 libraries. The theoretical template has a well-defined, very high (R = 20 000) resolution, so errors in this theoretical value do not affect our conclusions. Our approach based on the MARCS library was also crucial for constraining the resolution of the two empirical templates.  Results: We find that the MILES resolution is coarser than previously stated. We derive a new spectral resolution of 2.54 {\AA} FWHM, instead of the nominal 2.3 {\AA}. The reason for this difference is the previous overestimation of the resolution for the Indo-US library, which was used to estimate the MILES one. For the Indo-US library we obtain a new value of 1.35 {\AA} FWHM. Most important, the results derived from the MARCS and ELODIE libraries are in very good agreement.  Conclusions: These results are important for users of the MILES spectra library and for further development of stellar population models aimed at obtaining accurate stellar kinematics and spectroscopic properties of galaxies.},

Arbitrary input data sets can be included into our analysis and other stellar quantities, in addition to stellar age, effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, can be computed on demand. We lay out the mathematical framework of the method and apply it to several observational data sets, including high- and low-resolution spectra (UVES, NARVAL, HARPS, SDSS/SEGUE). We find that simpler approximations for the spectroscopic probability distribution function, which are inherent to past Bayesian approaches, lead to deviations of several standard deviations and unreliable errors on the same data. By its flexibility and the simultaneous analysis of multiple independent measurements for a star, it will be ideal to analyse and cross-calibrate the large ongoing and forthcoming surveys, like Gaia-European Southern Observatory (ESO), SDSS, Gaia and LSST.},
